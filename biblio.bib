	Abstract = {We use a new model of metarepresentational development to predict
	a cognitive deficit which could explain a crucial component of the
	social impairment in childhood autism. One of the manifestations
	of a basic metarepresentational capacity is a [`]theory of mind'.
	We have reason to believe that autistic children lack such a [`]theory'.
	If this were so, then they would be unable to impute beliefs to others
	and to predict their behaviour. This hypothesis was tested using
	Wimmer and Perner's puppet play paradigm. Normal children and those
	with Down's syndrome were used as controls for a group of autistic
	children. Even though the mental age of the autistic children was
	higher than that of the controls, they alone failed to impute beliefs
	to others. Thus the dysfunction we have postulated and demonstrated
	is independent of mental retardation and specific to autism.},

	This paper focuses on architectural aspects and more particularly
	on the organization of the robot decisional abilities for interacting
	with people. Indeed, our objective is to develop a management of
	human interaction that would be an integral part of a general robot
	control architecture. This should hopefully allow to come up with
	a principled way to deal with human-robot interaction for robot task
	achievement in presence of humans or in synergy with humans. Such
	an architecture should be the framework that would allow the robot
	to produce behaviors to accomplish its tasks but also produce behaviors
	that support its engagement vis-a-vis its human partner and interpret
	similar behaviors from him. We also intend to use the proposed approach
	as a framework in which we would develop and experiment various task
	planners and interaction schemes. Indeed, the robot should be able,
	for instance, to devise plans that allow it to execute its actions
	and to place itself to be seen by or to observe humans, according

	Abstract = {Ambient environments which integrate a number of sensing devices and
	actuators intended for use by human users need to be able to express
	knowledge about objects, their functions and their properties to
	assist in the performance of everyday tasks. For this to occur perceptual
	data must be grounded to symbolic information that in its turn can
	be used in the communication with the human. For symbolic information
	to be meaningful it should be part of a rich knowledge base that
	includes an ontology of concepts and common sense. In this work we
	present an integration between ResearchCyc and an anchoring framework
	that mediates the connection between the perceptual information in
	an intelligent home environment and the reasoning system.
	
	Through simple dialogues we validate how objects placed in the home
	environment are grounded by a network of sensors and made available
	to a larger KB where reasoning is exploited. This first integration
	work is a step towards integrating the richness of a KRR system developed
	over many years in isolation, with a physically embedded intelligent
	system.},

I'd be curious to know what kind of reasoning capability they actually have. * Their tests are conducted in a static environment. They don't take other agents into consideration (nothing like perspective taking or rich disambiguation). * No task planning at all (or at least, not discussed in this paper) More in details: - object identification based on viewpoint independent SIFT features - formalized anchoring system that explicitely match percieved attributes to predicates - Cyc predicates - ground 12 colors, based on a paper on color perception. Could be useful for us. - idem, they cite a paper on what spatial relations to compute - location of objects based on a previously provided semantic map (but not much on this semantic map) - two "memories": the robot memory stores the current list of percieved objects ; the archive memory stores what is not percieved anymore - uses directly Cyc (ie, 250 000 common sense concepts...), via CycL language -> 2nd and higher order logics (quantification over predicates, functions, etc) Remark: using 2nd order logic (ie meta statements), it would be easy to store the knowledge of each agent - disambiguation in concept name by asking human to decide amongst all concepts known by Cyc - template based natural language - experiment conducted in a "smart" indoor environmement + simple robot},

The child is asked: where Sally will look for the object when she will return? The paper explain that children under 4 (as well as autistic children) doesn't answer "on the table" The robot can successfully pass this test if and only if it has an explicit and independent model for Sally believes on the world. So it should work with ORO. But it's a great experiment to set up! - The ToMM-SP model: Leslie proposes a general Theory of Mind Mechanism model based on what he call M-representation. M-representation are made of four components. An (1) agent, an (2) attitude (Leslie names 3 of them: to pretend, to believe or to want), an (3) "aspect of the world that anchors the agent's attitude" and the (4) content of the attitude. The example he takes is a mother that plays and uses a banana as a phone. If correctly understood by the children, this scene can be interpreted as: the (1) mother (2) pretend-true (3) the banana (4) to be a telephone. I would be curious to know your opinion about how feasible it would be to get the robot to actually understand the "mother and banana" scene. In false-belief scenarii (like the Sally-Ann one), the child must be able to attribute a false belief to the agent. Leslie adds to the model ToMM model a Selection Processing (SP) that allows the belief attributer to /inhibit/ the default (true) belief that he/she would tend to attribute to the agent. The whole model looks extremely relevant for us and I think it could be integrated in our current modelling of knowledge.},

	mobile robots. The cooperation is composed of two phases: collaboration
	where a task is decomposed into subtasks and subtasks are allocated
	through a set of robots, and coordination where robots actually coordinate
	their activities to fulfil the initial task using the notion of coordinated
	protocols. This architecture exhibits benefits such as (1) modularity
	(the robot can work autonomously or within a team); (2) robustness
	(although some modules on the robot fail, it is still able to perform
	useful tasks); and (3) programmability. An example using two real

	The focus is principally on research that has been demonstrated in

	topics within multirobot systems -biological inspirations, communication,
	architectures, localization/mapping/exploration, object transport
	and manipulation, motion coordination, reconfigurable robots, and
	learning - and discuss the current state of research in these areas.
	As I describe each research area, I identify some key open issues
	in multirobot team research, and conclude by identifying several

	Abstract = {The idea of an axiom system having some models is explained more fully
	than in previous presentations, showing how the structure of a theory
	can give some semantic content to undefined symbols in that theory,
	making it unnecessary for all meanings to be derived bottom up from
	(grounded in) sensory experience, or sensory-motor contingencies.
	Although symbols need not be grounded, since they are mostly defined
	by the theory in which they are used, the theory does need to be
	"tethered", if is capable of being used for predicting and explaining
	things that happen, or making plans for acting in the real world.
	These ideas were quite well developed by 20th Century philosophers
	of science, and I now both attempt to generalise those ideas to be
	applicable to theories expressed using non-logical representations
	(e.g. maps, diagrams, working models, etc.) and begin to show how
	they can be used in explaining how a baby or a robot, can develop
	new concepts that have some semantic content but are not definable
	in terms of previously understood concepts. There is still much work
	to be done, but what needs to be done to explain how intelligent
	robots might work, and how humans and other intelligent animals learn
	about the environment, is very different from most of what is going
	on in robotics and in child and animal psychology.
	
	
	The addition of new explanatory hypotheses is abduction. Normally
	abduction uses pre-existing symbols. The simultaneous introduction
	of new symbols and new axioms (ontology-extending abduction) generates
	a very difficult problem of controlling search.},

	Abstract = {Mobile household robots need much knowledge about objects, places
	and actions when performing more and more complex tasks. They must
	be able to recognize objects, know what they are and how they can
	be used. We present a practical approach to robot knowledge representation
	that combines description logics knowledge bases with a rich environment
	model, data mining and (self-) observation modules. The robot observes
	itself and humans while executing actions and uses the collected
	experiences to learn models of action-related concepts grounded in
	its perception and action system. We demonstrate our approach by
	learning places that are involved in mobile robot manipulation actions,
	by locating objects based on their function and by supplying knowledge
	required for understanding underspecified task descriptions as commonly
	given by humans.},

	Abstract = {Service robots will have to accomplish more and more complex, open-ended
	tasks and regularly acquire new skills. In this work, we propose
	a new approach to generating
	
	plans for such household robots. Instead composing them from atomic
	actions --- the common approach in robot planning --- we propose to transform
	task descriptions on web sites like ehow.com into executable robot
	plans. We present methods for automatically converting the instructions
	from natural language into a formal, logic-based representation,
	for resolving the word senses using the WordNet database and the
	Cyc ontology, and for exporting the generated plans into the mobile
	robot's plan language RPL. We discuss the problems of inferring information
	missing in these descriptions, of grounding the abstract task descriptions
	in the perception and action system, and we propose techniques for
	solving them. The whole system works autonomously without human interaction.
	It has successfully been tested with a set of about 150 natural language
	directives, of which up to 80% could be correctly transformed.},

	using semiotic symbols. Semiotic symbols are defined by a triadic
	relation between forms, meanings and referents, thus having an implicit
	relation to the real world. Anchors are formed between these three
	elements rather than between `traditional' symbols and sensory images.
	This allows an optimization between the form (i.e. the `traditional'
	symbol) and the referent. A robotic experiment based on adaptive
	language games illustrates how the anchoring of semiotic symbols
	can be achieved in a bottom-up fashion. The paper concludes that
	applying semiotic symbols is a potentially valuable approach toward

@article{Ziemke1999,
	Abstract = {The grounding problem is, generally speaking, the problem of how to
	embed an artificial agent into its environment such that its behaviour,
	as well as the mechanisms, representations, etc. underlying it, can
	be intrinsic and meaningful to the agent itself, rather than dependent
	on an external designer or observer. This paper briefly reviews Searle's
	and Harnad's analyses of the grounding problem, and then evaluates
	cognitivist and enactive approaches to overcoming it. It is argued
	that, although these two categories of approaches differ in their
	nature and the problems they have to face, both, so far, fall short
	of solving the grounding problem for similar reasons. Further it
	is concluded that the reason the problem is still somewhat underestimated
	lies in the fact that modern situated and embodied AI, despite its
	emphasis of agent-environment interaction, still fails to fully acknowledge
	the historically rooted integrated nature of living organisms and
	their environmental embedding.},

	of a basic metarepresentational capacity is a [`]theory of mind'.
	We have reason to believe that autistic children lack such a [`]theory'.
	If this were so, then they would be unable to impute beliefs to others
	and to predict their behaviour. This hypothesis was tested using
	Wimmer and Perner's puppet play paradigm. Normal children and those
	with Down's syndrome were used as controls for a group of autistic
	children. Even though the mental age of the autistic children was
	higher than that of the controls, they alone failed to impute beliefs
	to others. Thus the dysfunction we have postulated and demonstrated
	is independent of mental retardation and specific to autism.}

	The processor features:
	
	- incremental language syntactic and semantic analysis

	- "back-channel" communication (like nodding, gaze direction) is used

	to produce behaviors to accomplish its tasks but also produce behaviors
	that support its engagement vis-a-vis its human partner and interpret
	similar behaviors from him. We also intend to use the proposed approach
	as a framework in which we would develop and experiment various task
	planners and interaction schemes. Indeed, the robot should be able,

	Through simple dialogues we validate how objects placed in the home
	environment are grounded by a network of sensors and made available
	to a larger KB where reasoning is exploited. This first integration

	objects ; the archive memory stores what is not percieved anymore
	
	- uses directly Cyc (ie, 250 000 common sense concepts...), via CycL
	language -> 2nd and higher order logics (quantification over predicates,
	functions, etc)
	
	Remark: using 2nd order logic (ie meta statements), it would be easy
	to store the knowledge of each agent

	all concepts known by Cyc

	A child watches this scene: Ann watches Sally to put an object in
	a basket. Sally leaves and Ann moves the object from the basket to
	the table.
	
	The child is asked: where Sally will look for the object when she
	will return?
	
	
	The paper explain that children under 4 (as well as autistic children)
	doesn't answer "on the table"
	
	The robot can successfully pass this test if and only if it has an
	explicit and independent model for Sally believes on the world. So
	it should work with ORO. But it's a great experiment to set up!
	
	
	- The ToMM-SP model: Leslie proposes a general Theory of Mind Mechanism
	model based on what he call M-representation. M-representation are
	made of four components. An (1) agent, an (2) attitude (Leslie names
	3 of them: to pretend, to believe or to want), an (3) "aspect of
	the world that anchors the agent's attitude" and the (4) content
	of the attitude.
	
	The example he takes is a mother that plays and uses a banana as a
	phone. If correctly understood by the children, this scene can be
	interpreted as: the (1) mother (2) pretend-true (3) the banana (4)
	to be a telephone.
	
	
	I would be curious to know your opinion about how feasible it would
	be to get the robot to actually understand the "mother and banana"
	scene.
	
	
	In false-belief scenarii (like the Sally-Ann one), the child must
	be able to attribute a false belief to the agent.
	
	Leslie adds to the model ToMM model a Selection Processing (SP) that
	allows the belief attributer to /inhibit/ the default (true) belief
	that he/she would tend to attribute to the agent.
	
	
	The whole model looks extremely relevant for us and I think it could
	be integrated in our current modelling of knowledge.},

	protocols. This architecture exhibits benefits such as (1) modularity

	useful tasks); and (3) programmability. An example using two real

	and manipulation, motion coordination, reconfigurable robots, and
	learning - and discuss the current state of research in these areas.

  abstract = {The idea of an axiom system having some models is explained more fully
	than in previous presentations, showing how the structure of a theory
	can give some semantic content to undefined symbols in that theory,
	making it unnecessary for all meanings to be derived bottom up from
	(grounded in) sensory experience, or sensory-motor contingencies.
	Although symbols need not be grounded, since they are mostly defined
	by the theory in which they are used, the theory does need to be
	"tethered", if is capable of being used for predicting and explaining
	things that happen, or making plans for acting in the real world.
	These ideas were quite well developed by 20th Century philosophers
	of science, and I now both attempt to generalise those ideas to be
	applicable to theories expressed using non-logical representations
	(e.g. maps, diagrams, working models, etc.) and begin to show how
	they can be used in explaining how a baby or a robot, can develop
	new concepts that have some semantic content but are not definable
	in terms of previously understood concepts. There is still much work
	to be done, but what needs to be done to explain how intelligent
	robots might work, and how humans and other intelligent animals learn
	about the environment, is very different from most of what is going
	on in robotics and in child and animal psychology.
	
	
	The addition of new explanatory hypotheses is abduction. Normally
	abduction uses pre-existing symbols. The simultaneous introduction
	of new symbols and new axioms (ontology-extending abduction) generates
	a very difficult problem of controlling search.},

  abstract = {Service robots will have to accomplish more and more complex, open-ended
	tasks and regularly acquire new skills. In this work, we propose
	a new approach to generating
	
	plans for such household robots. Instead composing them from atomic
	actions — the common approach in robot planning — we propose to transform
	task descriptions on web sites like ehow.com into executable robot
	plans. We present methods for automatically converting the instructions
	from natural language into a formal, logic-based representation,
	for resolving the word senses using the WordNet database and the
	Cyc ontology, and for exporting the generated plans into the mobile
	robot’s plan language RPL. We discuss the problems of inferring information
	missing in these descriptions, of grounding the abstract task descriptions
	in the perception and action system, and we propose techniques for
	solving them. The whole system works autonomously without human interaction.
	It has successfully been tested with a set of about 150 natural language
	directives, of which up to 80% could be correctly transformed.},

  abstract = {This paper presents arguments for approaching the anchoring problem
	using semiotic symbols. Semiotic symbols are defined by a triadic
	relation between forms, meanings and referents, thus having an implicit
	relation to the real world. Anchors are formed between these three
	elements rather than between ‘traditional’ symbols and sensory images.
	This allows an optimization between the form (i.e. the ‘traditional’
	symbol) and the referent. A robotic experiment based on adaptive
	language games illustrates how the anchoring of semiotic symbols
	can be achieved in a bottom-up fashion. The paper concludes that
	applying semiotic symbols is a potentially valuable approach toward
	anchoring.},

  year = {1999},
  pages = {177--190},
  abstract = {The grounding problem is, generally speaking, the problem of how to
	embed an artificial agent into its environment such that its behaviour,
	as well as the mechanisms, representations, etc. underlying it, can
	be intrinsic and meaningful to the agent itself, rather than dependent
	on an external designer or observer. This paper briefly reviews Searle’s
	and Harnad’s analyses of the grounding problem, and then evaluates
	cognitivist and enactive approaches to overcoming it. It is argued
	that, although these two categories of approaches differ in their
	nature and the problems they have to face, both, so far, fall short
	of solving the grounding problem for similar reasons. Further it
	is concluded that the reason the problem is still somewhat underestimated
	lies in the fact that modern situated and embodied AI, despite its
	emphasis of agent-environment interaction, still fails to fully acknowledge
	the historically rooted integrated nature of living organisms and
	their environmental embedding.},
